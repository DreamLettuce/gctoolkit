# Microsoft GCToolKit Developers Guide

---

## Introduction

GCToolkit is comprised of 3 Java modules, vertx, parser, and api. This document describes how each of these modules fits together to support the conversion of a garbage collection log to a stream of garbage collection events.
Additionally, GCToolkit contains several components that perform the heavy lifting. These components include, a framework to interact with data sources, diary, data source bus, parsers, and event source bus and finally, a framework to support the aggregation of events.
The purpose of this document is to provide a brief description of each of these components to aid in the further development of this toolkit.

### Data Source 

DataSource is an interface that supports the integration of a source of GC events. Currently GCToolkit is geared towards processing
events that have been recorded in a garbage collection log. The DataSource implementation could be another source such as a Java Flight Recorder recording.
1. Allocators which perform the work of getting data into Java heap
1. Garbage Collection (GC).

While GC is responsible for recovering memory in Java heap that is no longer in use, the term is often used as a euphemism for memory management. The phrasing of _Tuning GC_ or _tuning the collector_ are often used with the understanding that it refers to tuning the JVMâ€™s memory management subsystem. The best source of telemetry data for tuning GC comes from GC Logs and GCToolKit has been helpful in making this task easier by providing parsers, models and an API to build analytics with. You can run the Maven project [HeapOccupancyAfterCollectionSummary sample](./sample/README.md) as an example of this.

## Usage

In order to use this library you'll need to add its dependencies to your project. We provide the instructions for Maven below.

### Maven Coordinates

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.microsoft.gctoolkit/gctoolkit-parser.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22com.microsoft.gctoolkit%22%20AND%20a:%22gctoolkit-api%22)

The GCToolKit artifacts are in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.microsoft.gctoolkit). You'll then need to add the `api`, `parser` and `vertx` modules to your project in the `dependencyManagement` and/or `dependencies` section as you see fit.

```xml
<dependencies>
    ...
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.microsoft.gctoolkit</groupId>
        <artifactId>api</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.4</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.microsoft.gctoolkit</groupId>
        <artifactId>parser</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.4</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.microsoft.gctoolkit</groupId>
        <artifactId>vertx</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.4</version>
    </dependency>

    ...
</dependencies>
```
